 Nightly Clock App for Sailfish OS
 
 
 
Nightly Clock is a bedside Application for Sailfish OS

My first Application for Sailfish OS was a huge learning curve and a fun project to work on.


The code here is for v1.20 (29), bare in mind Nightly Clock releases went up in v0.01 increments.


Nightly Clock for Sailfish OS is built upon the base from BlackBerry 10 and added many notable features, these include:

Customisable clock faces,

Custom user designed Clock Faces ,

SHOUTcast internet radio integration,

Weather integration,

Sunrise Alarm

And much more!
